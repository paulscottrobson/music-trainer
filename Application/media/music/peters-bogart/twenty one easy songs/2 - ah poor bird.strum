Am///        Am///        Am///                   Am///
Ah poor bird why art thou lying in the shadows of this dark hour

Am///        Am///           Am///                    Am///
Ah poor bird take thy flight far above the sorrows of ah dark night

Am///        Am///      Am///                        Am///
Ah poor bird as you fly can you see the dawning of tomorrow's sky ?
